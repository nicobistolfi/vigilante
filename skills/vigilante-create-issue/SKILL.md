# Vigilante Create Issue

## Overview
Use this skill when a human wants to write or refine a GitHub issue that Vigilante will later implement. The goal is not to design the full solution for them. The goal is to turn a vague request into an issue with enough behavioral detail, constraints, and verification criteria for a headless coding agent to execute safely.

## Outcome
Produce a GitHub issue draft that is:

- specific about the problem and why it matters
- grounded in repository or product context
- explicit about expected behavior and non-goals
- realistic about implementation flexibility and hard constraints
- testable through concrete acceptance criteria
- clear about validation and regression coverage

## Workflow
1. Clarify the request before writing
- Identify the change the user actually wants.
- Ask for missing repository, product, or user context when it affects implementation.
- Separate required behavior from guesses or preferences.

2. Frame the issue around execution
- Write for the agent that will implement the issue later, not for a broad brainstorming audience.
- Prefer observable behavior over vague aspirations.
- Note any constraints that must be preserved: CLI flags, APIs, config compatibility, UX expectations, rollout limits, or performance boundaries.

3. Capture implementation guidance without over-constraining
- Include likely solution paths when they materially reduce ambiguity.
- Mark which implementation details are required and which are flexible.
- Call out known tradeoffs or rejected alternatives when relevant.

4. Make completion testable
- Convert expectations into pass/fail acceptance criteria.
- State what tests should be added or updated.
- Mention the key regressions or failure modes that must be prevented.

5. Deliver a ready-to-file issue
- Return a polished issue draft in Markdown.
- Keep it concise, but do not omit information needed for reliable execution.

## Required Sections
Every issue draft should cover these sections when relevant:

1. Problem statement
- What is wrong, missing, or desired?
- Why does this matter now?

2. Context
- What repository, product, or workflow context does the implementer need?
- What is the current behavior?
- Who is affected?
- What assumptions or constraints are already known?

3. Desired outcome
- What should be true after implementation?
- What is explicitly out of scope?

4. Possible implementation approaches
- What are the most plausible solution paths?
- Which details are required versus flexible?
- What tradeoffs should the implementer understand?

5. Acceptance criteria
- Use explicit, testable statements.
- Prefer behavior-focused checks over generic wording like "works correctly."

6. Testing expectations
- State which test layers matter: unit, integration, CLI, workflow, end-to-end, or manual verification.
- Mention critical regressions and failure modes that need coverage.

7. Operational or UX considerations
- Include logging, migrations, config compatibility, docs, observability, rollout, or backward compatibility concerns when applicable.

## Issue Quality Rules
- Do not leave "should support X" statements undefined when the expected behavior can be stated concretely.
- Do not hide key constraints inside prose if they materially affect implementation.
- Do not invent repository details that were not provided. Flag missing context instead.
- Do not overload the issue with speculative architecture unless the decision matters to execution.
- Do include non-goals so the eventual implementation stays narrow.
- Do include exact commands, files, components, or workflows when they are already known.

## Recommended Questions To Ask
Use these to tighten the issue before drafting:

- What exactly should change?
- What currently happens instead?
- Why is the change needed?
- What constraints must the implementation respect?
- Which solution options are acceptable, and which are not?
- How will we know the issue is done?
- What tests prove the change works?
- What regressions must be prevented?

## Output Template
Use this structure for the final issue draft:

```md
## Summary
<One short paragraph describing the problem and desired change.>

## Problem
- <What is wrong, missing, or desired>
- <Why it matters>

## Context
- <Current behavior>
- <Relevant repo, product, or workflow details>
- <Constraints or assumptions>

## Desired Outcome
- <Expected end-state>
- <Non-goals or out-of-scope items>

## Implementation Notes
- <Likely approach or options>
- <Required constraints vs flexible details>
- <Tradeoffs, if relevant>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <Specific observable behavior>
- [ ] <Specific observable behavior>

## Testing Expectations
- <Tests to add or update>
- <Failure modes or regressions to cover>

## Operational / UX Considerations
- <Docs, logging, migration, compatibility, rollout, observability, etc.>
```

## Final Checks
Before returning the issue draft, verify that:

- the problem is understandable without extra oral context
- the desired outcome is observable
- the acceptance criteria are testable
- the testing section names the expected validation
- the issue gives Vigilante enough direction to implement without guessing the basics
